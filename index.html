        <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
        <p>
          Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata. It shows how complex
          behavior can arise from simple rules. The state of each cell is
          determined by the state of it's 8 surrounding cells. Conways game of 
          life is traditionally set on an infinite grid. I have made a small 
          change and this grid wraps around. What goes off the right side of 
          the screen appears on the left, same with up and down.
